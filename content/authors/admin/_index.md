#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Biography

Rob Johnson is a Distinguished Researcher in the VMWare Research Group. He does theoretical work with an impact on the real world. He created SplinterDB, a high-performance key-value store that is at the heart of vSAN, VMware's storage-area networking software. He created the quotient filter, a high-performance alternative to the Bloom filter, which is used within SplinterDB and by multiple startups. He designed Mosaic Pages, a scheme for increasing the efficacy of hardware translation-lookaside buffers. He developed VeriBetrKV, a verified high-performance key-value store based on his earlier work on BetrFS, a file system that uses recent advances in data structures to improve performance on many operations by over an order of magnitude. He developed Squeakr, deBGR, and Mantis, a collection of tools for performing analyses on huge genomic data sets. He founded cache-adaptive analysis, a theoretical framework for designing and analyzing algorithms that dynamically share memory with other processes. He broke the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) crypto-system used in almost all DVD players and TVs. He wrote CQual, a static analysis tool that has found dozens of bugs in the Linux kernel and has been used to audit the entire Debian Linux distribution for format-string bugs.

Before joining VMWare, he was a Research Assistant Professor at Stony Brook University. He completed his PhD at UC Berkeley in 2006.
